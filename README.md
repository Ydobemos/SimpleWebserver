# SimpleWebserver
A simple Webserver for multiple Plattforms and Operating Systems

My Website, more Infos will be added later here:

This is a simple hhtp 1.0 Webserver for Delphi and Lazarus.
You can compile with Lazarus on all Systems and of course in Delphi.
Testet with Delphi 10.3 and different Lazarus Versions on different Plattforms and Operating Systems.

For Linux the Form looks a bit dfifferent, so i recommend to change 
unit1_linux.lfm  to unit1.lfm
and unit2_linux.lfm to unit2.lfm 
so the Forms also looks good on Linux Systems. For Windows Systems no change is required.

Pre-Compiled Versions exists.
They are all portable and ready to go/use.
For Linux you may set the user Permissions for execution before you can use it.

My Comments on the Source are in German and English, sorry...
